2 october 2019:

written two scripts to download the products from MPC FTP site:
download_mpc_monitoring.sh
download_mpc_longtermtrends.sh

Still to do:
write overall script, which calls the first one for directories:
2019
bb_counts
bb_temps
viscal_counts

and then calls the second one.

Then once data have been downloaded for a certain date, upload a file back which tells a CRON job on the CCTP that it can delete the data for that date.
Needs permissions to do so for data on CCTP.
And to work out how to upload a file in a shell script.

Then need to run the long term process to produce the website and the long term plots.
